# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction using AI/ML

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to predict **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) emissions** over time for various countries. Developed as part of an internship program by **Shell-Edunet** in collaboration with **AICTE**, the project supports the broader mission of promoting **green technology** and sustainability awareness.

Predictions made by the model can help policymakers, researchers, and environmentalists understand emission trends and plan interventions accordingly.


## 📌 Features

- Predicts historical and future trends of CO₂ emissions
- Analyzes emission patterns by country
- Visualizes trends using interactive graphs
- Helps in understanding the impact of different countries on global carbon emissions
- Built using latest stable **Python 3.13.5**
- Run on **Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code**


## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3.13.5
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with Jupyter extension
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `statsmodels`


## 📊 Sample Visualizations

- Line charts of CO₂ emissions over time
- charts comparing countries
- Forecast plots showing future emission trends
- Correlation heatmaps of variables

## 📈 How It Works

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Import historical CO₂ emission data from CSV files.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand trends, correlations, and outliers.
- **Model Building**:
  - Use regression or time series models (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost, ARIMA).
  - Train on past emission data.
- **Prediction & Visualization**: Predict future emissions and visualize them interactively.
- **Evaluation**: Measure accuracy using metrics like RMSE or MAE.


## 🌱 Green Technology Impact

By forecasting CO₂ emissions:

- Countries can design better environmental policies
- Companies can track and reduce carbon footprints
- Awareness can be raised for sustainable development goals (SDGs)
